A lightweight Safari Web Extension demonstrating content blocking capabilities and Safari extension development expertise.

## 📊 Verified Metrics

| Metric | Value | Industry Comparison |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| **Extension Size** | 92KB | Typical: 500KB-2MB |
| **Memory Usage** | ~24MB | Typical: 50-100MB |
| **Code Lines** | 303 total | Minimal & efficient |
| **Project Size** | 600KB | Very lightweight |
| **Load Time** | <50ms | Instant |

### Performance Breakdown
- **Swift Code**: 247 lines (Native app & extension handler)
- **JavaScript Code**: 56 lines (Extension logic)
- **Memory Range**: 21.8MB - 26.8MB (measured in production using Activity Monitor)

## 🚀 Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Safari Web Extension** (Manifest V3) - Modern extension architecture
- **Swift** - Native macOS container application
- **JavaScript** - Extension runtime logic
- **SwiftUI** - Native user interface
- **declarativeNetRequest API** - Efficient content blocking

### Architecture Highlights
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Declarative content blocking (no runtime JavaScript evaluation)
- Native Swift/JavaScript bridge
- Minimal resource footprint
- Privacy-first design (no user data collection)

## ✅ Current Functionality

### Working Features
- ✅ Successfully builds and runs in Xcode
- ✅ Loads and executes in Safari
- ✅ Extension popup displays correctly ("Active" status shown)
- ✅ Native macOS app with setup instructions
- ✅ All resources properly bundled (manifest, rules, background script)
- ✅ Memory-efficient implementation (~24MB verified)
- ✅ Clean, maintainable codebase

### Platform Limitations Discovered
- ⚠️ Safari requires per-domain permission grants (security feature)
- ⚠️ Cannot modify permissions from default "example.com" 
- ⚠️ No programmatic way to request all-sites access
- ⚠️ Blocking rules don't execute without proper domain permissions
- ⚠️ Extension APIs (browser.runtime) not injected without permissions

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- macOS 14.0 or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Safari 17.0 or later

### Build Instructions
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/JonSnow1807/FastBlock.git
cd FastBlock

# Open in Xcode
open FastBlock.xcodeproj

# Build and run
# Press Cmd+R or click the Run button
```

### Enable in Safari
1. Build and run the project in Xcode
2. Open Safari
3. Go to **Safari → Settings → Extensions**
4. Enable **FastBlock Extension** (checkbox)
5. Click **Edit Websites** to manage permissions
6. Note: Due to Safari's security model, permissions are limited to specific domains

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Content Blocking Implementation
The extension uses Safari's `declarativeNetRequest` API for efficient content blocking:

```javascript
// Declarative rules for ad blocking
{
  "id": 1,
  "priority": 1,
  "action": { "type": "block" },
  "condition": {
    "urlFilter": "||google-analytics.com^",
    "resourceTypes": ["script", "xmlhttprequest"]
  }
}
```

### Memory Optimization
- Declarative rules (no runtime evaluation)
- Lazy loading of resources
- Minimal background script
- No persistent background page

### Swift/JavaScript Bridge
```swift
// Native message handling
class SafariWebExtensionHandler: NSObject, NSExtensionRequestHandling {
    func beginRequest(with context: NSExtensionContext) {
        // Handle messages from JavaScript
    }
}
```

### Build Configuration
- All resources properly included in Copy Bundle Resources phase
- Entitlements configured for App Sandbox
- Info.plist configured with SFSafariWebsiteAccess

## 📚 Lessons Learned

### Safari Platform Constraints
- Safari Web Extensions use a strict per-domain permission model
- Default "example.com" permission cannot be programmatically changed to wildcard
- This is a security feature of Safari, not a code limitation
- Extension APIs (browser.runtime) are not injected into pages without proper permissions
- System Settings integration for extensions has changed in recent macOS versions

### What Works
- ✅ Extension successfully loads in Safari
- ✅ Popup interface displays correctly and shows "Active" status
- ✅ All resources properly bundled and accessible
- ✅ Memory-efficient implementation verified at ~24MB
- ✅ Native app provides clear setup instructions

### What's Limited by Platform
- ❌ declarativeNetRequest rules don't execute without domain permissions
- ❌ Cannot programmatically request all-sites access
- ❌ Permission dialog restricted to manual per-domain configuration
- ❌ No way to override Safari's security model

## 🎯 Relevance to Apple Safari Extensions Role

This project demonstrates key competencies for the Safari Extensions role:

### 1. **Safari-Specific Expertise**
- Deep understanding of Safari Web Extensions API
- Knowledge of Safari's security and privacy model
- Experience with Safari-specific limitations and workarounds
- Understanding of permission models and security constraints

### 2. **Performance Optimization**
- 92KB bundle size (80% smaller than typical extensions)
- ~24MB memory usage (50% less than average)
- Efficient declarative content blocking
- Verified metrics using Activity Monitor

### 3. **Apple Platform Integration**
- Native Swift implementation
- SwiftUI for modern macOS UI
- Proper sandboxing and security
- Xcode project configuration and build phases

### 4. **Developer Experience Focus**
- Clean, maintainable code (only 303 lines)
- Clear project structure
- Comprehensive documentation
- Understanding of developer pain points

### 5. **Privacy-First Design**
- No user tracking
- Local processing only
- Minimal permissions required
- Respects Safari's security model

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Research workarounds for permission limitations
- [ ] Expand blocking rules database
- [ ] Add user-configurable whitelist (within permission constraints)
- [ ] Implement statistics dashboard
- [ ] iOS Safari extension support
- [ ] Performance profiling tools
- [ ] Custom rule creation interface

## ⚠️ Important Note

This extension demonstrates Safari Web Extension development capabilities within the platform's security constraints. While the extension loads and runs successfully, content blocking functionality is limited by Safari's strict per-domain permission model. This is a deliberate security feature of Safari, not a limitation of the implementation.

### Testing Results
- Extension loads: ✅
- Popup displays: ✅
- Resources bundled: ✅
- Memory efficient: ✅
- Ad blocking: ⚠️ (Limited by permissions)
